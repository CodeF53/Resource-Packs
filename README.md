# Resource Packs
Collection of Resource Packs I have made for Minecraft.

## F53s GUI
A Dark, Matte, and Sharp GUI.

### Mod Compat
F53s GUI Mod Compat makes mod GUIs match the same clean look of the base pack.\

Heavily work in progress.\
All the GUI files from mods I have ripped are in `\preppedAssets\`, waiting to be modified

### Brewing Guide
A small edit of the [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/) Brewing Guide pack to fit the F53s GUI style

## Snapshot Content for VanillaXBR
Temporary textures for the new content in snapshots.\
Designed as an addon for Misterk7_-'s excellent [VanillaXBR](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/vanillaxbr-texture-pack/) texture pack.

Made by putting snapshot textures put into [PackXBR](https://github.com/CodeF53/PackXBR/), then cleaning them up a bit.

## Tweaks
A collection of good resource packs, with minor edits here and there.
